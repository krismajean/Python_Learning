# Speed of Computation

We know computers are fast, but exactly how much faster are they than you?
In an effort to illustrate the speed of computers to begin a talk on machine learning,  this program was written to give humans a reference to how much faster their computer is. 

This program can either generate or accept 4 2-digit numbers to combine like a basic perceptron (multiply two values then add products).

This program was written using python3 print statements

## Use

`speedmath.py [-h] [users]

users: The number of users to create numbers for the experiment (default: 1)


## Operation:

        Select 4 random 2 digit numbers between 10 and 100
        Then let's time how long it takes you to:
            Multiple two of them
            Add the two products

        Eg:	34	82	19	65
                34 x 82 = 2,788	    19 x 65 = 1,235
                2,788 + 1,235 = 4,023
